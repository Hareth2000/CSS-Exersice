# CSS-Exersice
# Task Summary

In this task, I have demonstrated the use of various HTML elements and CSS techniques to create a styled webpage. Below are the key features used:

## HTML Elements Used

- **Block Elements**: I used block elements such as `div` and `p` to create structured content. These elements occupy the full width available, stacking vertically.
  
- **Inline Elements**: Inline elements like `span` were used for styling parts of the text without disrupting the flow of the document.

- **Lists**: Different types of lists were utilized:
  - **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)**: Used for lists where the order matters.
  - **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)**: Used for lists where the order doesn't matter.

- **Links**: Hyperlinks (`<a>`) were used to create navigation between pages and external resources.

## CSS Implementation

- I created a **CSS file** to style the HTML elements.
- The CSS was linked to the HTML file in **three ways**:
  1. **Inline**: Using the `style` attribute directly in HTML elements.
  2. **Internal**: Using a `<style>` block within the `<head>` section of the HTML.
  3. **External**: Linking an external CSS file using the `<link>` tag in the HTML `<head>`.
